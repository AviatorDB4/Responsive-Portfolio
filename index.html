      <p>David Deboer Barton was born on October 11th, 1992.</p>

      <p>Growing up, I participated in sports (Baseball, Soccer, Tennis, and Cub/Boy Scouts. Around fifth grade I was able to start learning an instrument and chose the Trumpet later switching to Alto Sax which later became my main instrument of choice. All together I have played around five instruments.</p>

      <p>As a laid back and relativily quiet person I'd rather spend my nights relaxing at home with my feet up on the couch rather than going out.</p>
